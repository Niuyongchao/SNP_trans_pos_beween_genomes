# SNP_trans_pos_beween_genomes


Project Description (English)
The purpose of this project is to facilitate the transformation and integration of coordinates of different SNP data sets. With the development of genomics, more and more species have more than one reference genome. In addition, different studies may use different versions of reference sequences, leading to the inability to directly integrate and compare their SNP datasets. If all the raw sequencing data are downloaded for alignment and SNP calling again, it will consume a lot of computing resources and time costs. In addition, for population evolution, GWAS and other studies, when SNPs reach a certain density, their results will be basically consistent. Therefore, even if some SNPs were lost during the integrated process, the reliability of analysis results will not be affected.






项目中文说明
本研究的目的主要是为了方便不同SNP数据集坐标的转换和整合。随着基因组学的发展，越来越多的物种都拥有不止一个参考基因组，另外不同的研究可能采用不同版本的参考序列，导致其SNP数据集无法直接整合比较，如果下载全部的原始数据重新进行比对和SNP检测，将耗费大量的计算资源和时间成本。另外对于群体进化，GWAS等研究，SNP达到一定密度之后，其结果将基本一致，所以即使SNP数据整合之后有位点丢失，仍不影响分析结果的可靠性。
